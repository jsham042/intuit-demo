# Executive Summary: Quick Connect - AI-Powered Specialist Routing

## Overview

Quick Connect is an intelligent specialist routing system that leverages AI and semantic search technology to connect Intuit customer service agents with the right subject matter expert in seconds. By understanding the meaning and context of customer issues—not just keywords—the system dramatically reduces routing time and improves first-contact resolution.

## How It Works

### The User Experience

Quick Connect offers three intuitive search modes:

1. **Intelligent Search** - Agents describe the customer's issue in natural language (e.g., "customer needs help with rental property depreciation"). The AI instantly identifies the top matching specialists from a pool of 125+ experts.

2. **Search by Name** - Real-time filtering allows agents to quickly find specialists by typing part of their name.

3. **Recently Used** - One-click access to the last 10 specialists contacted, streamlining repeat interactions.

### The Technology

The system uses **vector embeddings** and **semantic search** to understand intent:

- Each of our 125+ specialists has a detailed profile describing their expertise
- These profiles are converted into mathematical representations (embeddings) that capture meaning
- When an agent searches, the system compares the customer's issue against all specialists simultaneously
- Results are ranked by relevance with confidence scores, ensuring the best match rises to the top

**Unlike traditional keyword search**, this technology understands that "help with Schedule C" and "self-employment tax questions" refer to the same specialist—even when the words are different.
